### 🟢 Core (MVP)

These force you to touch Rust basics early.

- Create / edit / delete tasks
- Task status: `Todo | In Progress | Done`
- Task priority: `Low | Medium | High`
- Due date
- Local persistence (file or SQLite)
- App tray (minimize to tray)
- Keyboard shortcuts (create task, mark done)

### 🟡 Intermediate

Where Rust starts to shine.

- Task tags (many-to-many)
- Task search & filtering
- Undo / redo (command pattern)
- Background reminders (native notifications)
- Import / export tasks (JSON / CSV)
- App auto-start on OS boot
- Config file (theme, default priority)
